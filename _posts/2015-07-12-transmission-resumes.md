###So where have you been?

You may have noticed that I haven't posted to this blog in a while, so what happened?

[You'll recall from this post ]({% post_url 2014-10-01-done-something-stupid %}) that I'd got a place in the London Marathon. Well, it turns out that training for a marathon takes up a lot of time. A LOT of time. Runners even have a name for it, they call it paying the social debt; every minute you spend running is a minute you're not doing something else that you used to do, so some things have to give and sadly this blog was one of those things. Besides, my updates would've been something along the lines of:

Today I went running again.  
I went running again today.  
Running again today went I.

There's only a limited number of permutations of those 5 words and things would've got pretty boring pretty quickly, so posting tailed off.

It was all going well until Christmas of last year, I was well on top of my training plan when I managed to sprain a rib by sneezing. Yes that is possible and it's one of the most painful things I've ever done to myself. Needless to say, this put an end to any marathon plans. Sadly it also marked the end of my mental health, I was diagnosed with depression and signed off work.

I might post about how I've managed my recovery from depression one day, but right now I'm not quite ready to put that into the public domain. suffice to say that I've made a number of life changes. I have a new job, I'm taking better care of myself and I'm trying to pick back up a number of projects I had on the go before I got ill, this blog being one of them.

So, here's to better health, both physical and mental, and transmission resumes!
