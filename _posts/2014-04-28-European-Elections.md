Apparently there're some European elections coming up. I've heard the rumblings of the politicians but I wasn't really paying attention until my polling card came through the post the other day. Yes, apparently I'm part of the problem...

Voting is important, but it's also important to know *what* you're voting for. As the only election material I've seen so far in Leeds is from UKIP, several posters and a leaflet throughout the door, I thought I'd look into how easy it is to find the main parties' election manifestos on their websites. I'm passing on the SNP as they probably aren't fielding a candidate in Leeds, but in order of their share of the vote at the last general election, here's what I found.

I should note that this is just details of how easy it was to find each party's manifesto, not a comment on the contents of that manifesto. You'll have to read those for yourself!

##The Conservative Party
The Conservative website is here: <http://www.conservatives.com/>. 

When I was doing a first draft of this post on Sunday, I couldn't find any details of the European elections on their site, but the it seems to have been updated since then. Halfway down the page on the right hand side is a box clearly labeled 'EUROPEAN ELECTIONS 2014'. If you click on 'sign up' it takes you to a page where there's a clear link to the manifesto in a number of formats.

[The manifesto itself is here](http://www.conservatives.com/europe/~/media/Files/Downloadable%20Files/MANIFESTO%202014/Euro%20Manifesto%20English.ashx)

Not the most obvious signposting, but the information is at least there if you go hunting for it: **6/10**

##The Labour Party
The Labour party website is here: <http://www.labour.org.uk/home>.

Searching the main page for 'Europe' or 'European' gives no results. You can find some hits for the word 'Election' but that's steers you to a big clock counting down to the next UK General election.

In the 'About' section at the top of the page, there's a link to "Labour candidates for the next election", but that's a link to a list of candidates for the next Parliamentary elections, nothing for the European election.

Labour don't seem to care about the European Elections, manifesto not found: **0/10**

##The Liberal Democrats
The Lib Dem website is here: <http://www.libdems.org.uk/>

There're a few references to Europe on their website, not surprising given their pro-european stance, but I couldn't find anything close to an 2014 election manifesto. Just like Labour, manifesto not found: **0/10**

##UKIP

Ukip's website is here: <http://www.ukip.org/>

Right at the top of the page is a dropdown menu labeled 'getINFORMED' which has a link right to the manifesto, [which is here](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/themes/5308a93901925b5b09000002/attachments/original/1398167812/EuroManifestoMarch.pdf?1398167812) 

Manifesto found in seconds in a clear link at the top of the homepage: **10/10**

##BNP

Sorry, not going there, not even in the name of research.

##The Green Party

The Green Party website is here: <http://greenparty.org.uk/>

The Green Party don't seem to have a dedicated election manifesto, but if you click on the 'Elections' link which is front-and-centre at the top of the homepage, you get directly to their list of candidates for the European elections.

Right next to that is 'Policy' link that takes you to a breakdown of the party's policies, with links to detailed policy documents: [Green Policies](http://greenparty.org.uk/policies.html)

It's not a specific election manifesto, but all the information is at least readily available: **9/10**

###So what?

In this highly unscientific bit of poking about, it looks as though the main parties aren't all that bothered by the upcoming elections, or at least they're not bothering much yet. The smaller parties on the other hand seem to be out of the blocks and actively campaigning.

When the main parties seem to be making so little effort, is it any wonder that turnouts are falling in elections? I wonder what the excuses the talking heads will come up with after the election for the turn-out and/or the swings to those parties that have actually done something to get people to vote for them?
