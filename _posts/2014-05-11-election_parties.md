title: European Elections - Anti European Sentiment
tags: opinion, politics
---

A posted a while ago [(back here)](/2014/04/28/European-Elections.html) about the main parties and what information they had on their websites. That was back before the deadline for candidate registration, now that the deadline's passed I thought I'd look up who's standing in my region.

The full list of who's standing in Yorkshire and Humberside is here: <http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Statement%20of%20parties%20nominated%20and%20notice%20of%20poll.pdf>.

If you want to look up your own region then they're all listed here: [The official list of candidates standing on the 2014 European Parliament elections](http://www.europarl.org.uk/en/european_elections/candidates2014.html) or the BBC have a version here: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27142516>. 

References presented, here's the list of parties who're standing in my region:

* An Independence from Europe <http://www.aipmep.org/>
* British National Party <http://www.bnp.org.uk/>
* Conservative Party <http://conservativeeurope.com/>
* English Democrats <http://www.englishdemocrats.org.uk/>
* Green Party <http://greenparty.org.uk/>
* Labour Party <http://www.labour.org.uk/labour-in-europe>
* Liberal Democrats - <http://www.libdems.org.uk/in_europe>
* NO2EU <http://www.no2eu.com/>
* UK Independence Party (UKIP) <http://www.ukip.org/>
* Yorkshire First - <http://www.yorkshirefirst.org.uk/>The first thing that stands out is how many parties are standing on an anti-european ticket. My my crude classification, 6 of the 10 parties are overtly anti-european or at least euro-sceptic. 2 are neutral and only 2 are pro-european.
That's a lot of anti-european sentiment. These aren't just people spouting down the pub or in the comments section of the Daily Mail, these are people who're committed enough to get organised, fill out the requisite forms and raise the Â£5000 deposit it takes to stand for election.
It's starting to feel like the last round of European elections when the BNP surprised everybody with their electoral success (<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8088381.stm>) which many commentators at the time put down to the lack of debate by the mainstream parties about the effect of the European Union and all the related issues around immigration and people turning to the BNP as the only party (at the time) that was talking about issue.
The main parties don't seem to have learnt their lesson as they still don't seem to be interested in having that debate. For better or worse, if the mainstream parties aren't interested in talking about an issue that sections of the population care about those people will, regardless of any other idiocy in their manifesto, go and find the ones that are, and it's looking like we're seeing this happening again.
