I was ill recently. Nothing serious, just a bout of flu that knocked me off my feet for a few days. While I was in the "not well enough to go to work but not ill enough to be in bed" stages the postman delivered a load of junkmail. This set my slightly fevered brain off and I started thinking to myself "where does all that junkmail come from?"

So being a geek with some time on my hands, I quicky fired up an sqlite database to let me keep track of who's sending me all this junkmaik, and of course any good sqlite database needs a web front end to visualise the data, so this was born:

No idea what I'm going to do with this now I've got it. I guess I'll see how it develops as the data set grows.

Once a scientist, always a scientist I guess!
