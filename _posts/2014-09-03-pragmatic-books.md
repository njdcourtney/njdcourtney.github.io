My very good friend Andy Knighton blogs about writing, you should go and read his blog here <http://andrewknighton.com/> as he writes far more eloquently than me.

One of the recurring themes in Andy's blog is the ongoing changes in the publishing industry and what these means for authors as eBooks, and Amazon's Kindle in particular, take the book world by storm.

The book publishing is just the latest part of the entertainment industry to be hit with the disruptive change of new new technology and it's always interesting to see history repeating itself. When you look back at the history of IT, particular consumer products, the repeating cycle is that company or technology that comes to dominate the market is not necessarily the first into that market but rather the first to make that technology easy to use.

Apple were nowhere near the first company to release an MP3 player, but what they did do was to be the first to make an easy to use integrated system. Exactly the same has happened in the eBook world with Kindle and the Kindle store. The Kindle wasn't the first ereader and as a piece of hardware it's not noticalby better than any of the others, but what Amazon did successfully was to build an end-to-end system that made it easy for people to buy books and get them onto their device.

When it comes to consumer electronics, ease of use wins every time.

So far, so said by other people a thousand times before, so what's the point?

The point is that if you're going to survive in the brave new world, you need to make your products easy to buy and easy to consume, what lead me to write this post is the example of a company who I think are doing it right.

The [Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com/) publish books for developers. When you buy a book directly from them you get the choice of physical, eBook or both. If you buy the eBook they provide it in PDF, .epub and .mobi formats ensuring that you can read it on pretty much any ereader out there. Their store integrates with Dropbox so when you buy a book it automatically appears in your Dropbox and is synced to my computer and they make use of the Kindle personal document service to send my new book directly to my Kindle.

This is how it should be done, I click on a book I want, pay for it and within a few seconds the PDF is on my laptop and the ebook is on my Kindle. No mess, no scrabbling around for cables, it just happens. If they release a new version of any of the books I've bought, they automatically update my Dropbox and Kindle with the latest version, they'll even give you a discount off the ebook versions if you've bought the physical version somewhere else. 

That's how you set up a book shop in the 21st century.
