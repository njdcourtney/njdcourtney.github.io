Over the last couple of days, we've visited two fabulous National Trust properties Wray Castle ()[NT Website](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wray-castle/)) and Allen Banks ([NT Website](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/allan-bank-and-grasmere/))

If your idea of the perfect National Trust property is a perfectly preserved stately home filled with old and delicate furniture, then there's nothing here for you, these places are completely different.

Wray Castle has only been open to the public in the last few years, before that it was a conference centre and it definitely shows. The further you get from the entrance, the more the neutral brown carpets appear and the corporate beige becomes ever more apparent.

So what makes this place so great? In this shell they've filled pretty much every room with things for kids to do. The main room on the ground floor is a 'build your own castle' room, they've put in about a hundred foam blocks and the room with filled with kids building and knocking down towers and generally having a great time. Not "look but don't touch" here! There was dressing up, drawing, learning to dry-stone wall and this is the library:

in the absence of books they've painted a blank bookshelf on the wall and provided chalk for people to fill in the spines with the names of their favourite books. Just fantastic, even if some of the parents were clearing showing off with books that I'm absolutely positive they've read all the way through... 

If you've going to visit, do take their advice about taking the boat the Wray Castle, not only is it a very pleasant way to cross the lake, they're not kidding when they say there's very little car parking.

The other place we went to is Allan Bank on the outskirts of Grassmere. I think I can safely say that this is the only National Trust house I've ever been to where we were invited to help ourselves to the complementary tea and coffee and feel free to take it anywhere in the house. 

Like Wray Castle, with a critical eye, the house is in a bad way. It was leased as a private residence until a fire in 2010 caused the roof to collapse. After it was patched up, it opened to the public in 2012. There's plenty of bare plaster on show, but they've filled each room with something to do for the whole family. You can start that novel on one of the typewriters in Wordsworth's old study or take a book off the shelf and settle into one of the armchairs in the library. There's a kids play room and a garden perfect for picnics with fabulous views over Grassmere itself. This isn't a house you look at, this is a house you settle into for the day and relax in.

As these houses are restored I hope they don't lose their sense of fun. It would be a real shame if, as the fittings and fixtures are brought back to their original glory, the ropes went back up and they became just another old house to look at but not touch.
