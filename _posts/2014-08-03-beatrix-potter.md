I've not had chance to write a post for a while, things at work have been crazily busy, more about that in a future post. For now the family and I are enjoying a well-deserved holiday in the Lake District.

This being North-Western England, and the Lake District in particular, it's raining so we were on the lookout for somewhere toddler friendly and indoors.

We settled on the "World of Peter Rabbit Attraction" in Bowness-on-Windermere: <http://www.hop-skip-jump.com/> as somewhere toddler-friendly.

Being a cynical and sleep-deprived grown-up I was fearing the worst but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.

The attraction is split into three parts, the first is a short film telling a bit about Beatrix Potter and the inspiration for the stories. This was well pitched with enough content to keep the adults interested but only 4 minutes or so long, so not so long that the little ones got bored.

The second section was a walk-through of scenes from the various stories:

These were really well done and, importantly, were all down at young-child height. This is something that lots of places get wrong, even those explicitly aimed at children. There's also a lovely looking (and award-winning) garden. We gave that a miss because of the pouring rain, but the pictures looked lovely.

The final section is an interactive room with short films and an interactive table (think a table-sized iPad) with toddler-appropriate games and a map showing all the sites with a Beatrix Potter connection in the area, which our little one loved.

If you've got a toddler who likes the Beatrix Potter stories and you need to kill a rainy hour in the Bowness area, you can do much worse that drop in here.
