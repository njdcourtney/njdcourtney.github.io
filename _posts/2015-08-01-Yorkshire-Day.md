I, Nathan Courtney, being a resident of the West Riding of Yorkshire declare:

 * That Yorkshire is three Ridings and the City of York, with these Boundaries of 1140 years standing.
 * That the address of all places in these Ridings is Yorkshire
 * That all persons born therein or resident therein and loyal to the Ridings are Yorkshiremen and women
 * That any person or corporate body which deliberately ignores or denies the aforementioned shall forfeit all claim to Yorkshire status.

These declarations made this Yorkshire Day 2015.

God Save the Queen!
