I'm not intending this to be a political blog, there just happens to be an election happening. Normal service will be resumed soon...

As I write this post these are the current results in the English local elections:

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped">

By any objective measure Labour have won this election handsomely. They control the most councils, have gained the most councils, they've won the most seats, have gained the most seats and have the largest share of the vote. In five out of five metrics, they've come top.

So why is all the reporting about UKIP?

In a very unscientific survey, these are the political headlines around the major news websites at the moment:

 * BBC: [Farage: UKIP now 'serious players'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27531094)  
 * Guardian: [Ukip delivers first tremors of political earthquake](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live)  
 * Telegraph: [Sack Cameron if you want to win in 2015, Farage tells Tory MPs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/local-elections/10850464/Local-elections-2014-results-Live.html)  
 * The Independent: [Has Farage had the last laugh? Dismissed as ‘racists, fruitcakes and clowns’, Ukip tears up the political landscape on a remarkable day](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/local-election-results-2014-nigel-farage-hails-ukips-political-earthquake-and-vows-more-to-come-9428480.html)  
 * Yahoo! News: [Local Elections: UKIP Makes Significant Gains](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/polls-close-local-european-elections-205018882.html)

There're lots more but I think that's made the point, nowhere could I see a headline saying 'Labour win local elections'

Looking at the results for UKIP; they control no councils, are fourth in terms of seats won and fourth in terms of share of the vote. By any reasonable reading of the facts they're come fourth in this election and yet all of the coverage is about how well they done and Nigel Farage is being lauded as the all-conquering hero as if he were about to move into Downing Street.

The news cycles seem to be full of stories about UKIP because journalists have decided to make them the story and have created a self-fulfilling prophecy.

People often talk about holding politicians to account, but is it time we started holding journalists to task and demanding at least objective reporting of the facts?
