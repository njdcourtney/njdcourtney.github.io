title: Dropbox Camera Upload

I currently use Dropbox quite a lot, it's my go-to solution for backing up photos on my phone before filing them away properly and for sharing single docs. That said, I might be reconsidering this situation soon [given who they've just appointed to their board](http://www.drop-dropbox.com/), but I digress.

Dropbox recently announed a new app [Carousel](https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/04/introducing-carousel/) and I downloaded it to have a play. It's very pretty but I couldn't see myself using it, so I pretty quickly deleted it from my phone.

One of the features of Dropbox that I make use of is automatic [camera uploads](https://www.dropbox.com/help/289/en) but I just noticed that a couple of pictures I'd taken on my phone hadn't appeared in my Dropbox. I opened up the app, clicked the photos tab and a helpful message was at the top of the screen telling me that camera uploads were now being done by Carousel. Which I'd deleted... Thanks dropbox, by all means move functionality to your new app but you could at least tell people!

A couple of clicks turned auto-uploads back on, but if you use auto uploads and have played with Carousel you might want to double-check your settings.
