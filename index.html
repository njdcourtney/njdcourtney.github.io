<h3 class="text-primary">About</h3>
<p>I'm a Senior Network Engineer at <a href="http://www.callcredit.co.uk/">Call Credit Information Group</a>, boardgamer, role-player and general run of the mill geek. Former Astrophysicist.</p>
<p>The main reason for starting this site and it's blog is that I got fed up of posting things on various sites and then not being able to find them again. I'm a Unix geek, if I can't grep it it's no use to me...</p>
