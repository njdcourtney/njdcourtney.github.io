I'm a big fan of open-source software and I like to give credit where it's due.

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static web page generator.

The layout is based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and uses the flatly theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), kidly served by the guys at [MaxCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)

The site itself is served using [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) and you can grab the source for this site from my [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/njdcourtney/njdcourtney.github.io)

Isn't the world of open source lovely...
