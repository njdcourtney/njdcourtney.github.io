I"=<p>I’m a bit late making this point and many people on the Internet have expressed these sentiments far more eloquently then I can, but for the record, Syria.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, all of Syria is in one of three states:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In rubble.</li>
  <li>An active war zone</li>
  <li>In the hands of one of a number of brutal totalitarian regimes where torture and summary executions are the norm</li>
</ol>

<p>Given this - wouldn’t any sensible person want to get the hell out of there?</p>

<p>The people currently walking across Europe and clinging to tiny boats on the Mediterranean aren’t some “swarm” of rodents to be vilified and feared, they’re people doing their best to keep themselves and their families alive through a brutal and bloody civil war.</p>

<p>How about we give them a hand?</p>
