I"÷<p>Iâ€™m not intending this to be a political blog, there just happens to be an election happening. Normal service will be resumed soonâ€¦</p>

<p>As I write this post these are the current results in the English local elections:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped">

<p>By any objective measure Labour have won this election handsomely. They control the most councils, have gained the most councils, theyâ€™ve won the most seats, have gained the most seats and have the largest share of the vote. In five out of five metrics, theyâ€™ve come top.</p>

<p>So why is all the reporting about UKIP?</p>

<p>In a very unscientific survey, these are the political headlines around the major news websites at the moment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BBC: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27531094">Farage: UKIP now â€˜serious playersâ€™</a></li>
  <li>Guardian: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live">Ukip delivers first tremors of political earthquake</a></li>
  <li>Telegraph: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/local-elections/10850464/Local-elections-2014-results-Live.html">Sack Cameron if you want to win in 2015, Farage tells Tory MPs</a></li>
  <li>The Independent: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/local-election-results-2014-nigel-farage-hails-ukips-political-earthquake-and-vows-more-to-come-9428480.html">Has Farage had the last laugh? Dismissed as â€˜racists, fruitcakes and clownsâ€™, Ukip tears up the political landscape on a remarkable day</a></li>
  <li>Yahoo! News: <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/polls-close-local-european-elections-205018882.html">Local Elections: UKIP Makes Significant Gains</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thereâ€™re lots more but I think thatâ€™s made the point, nowhere could I see a headline saying â€˜Labour win local electionsâ€™</p>

<p>Looking at the results for UKIP; they control no councils, are fourth in terms of seats won and fourth in terms of share of the vote. By any reasonable reading of the facts theyâ€™re come fourth in this election and yet all of the coverage is about how well they done and Nigel Farage is being lauded as the all-conquering hero as if he were about to move into Downing Street.</p>

<p>The news cycles seem to be full of stories about UKIP because journalists have decided to make them the story and have created a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>People often talk about holding politicians to account, but is it time we started holding journalists to task and demanding at least objective reporting of the facts?</p>
