I"Í<p>A posted a while ago <a href="/2014/04/28/European-Elections.html">(back here)</a> about the main parties and what information they had on their websites. That was back before the deadline for candidate registration, now that the deadlineâ€™s passed I thought Iâ€™d look up whoâ€™s standing in my region.</p>

<p>The full list of whoâ€™s standing in Yorkshire and Humberside is here: <a href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Statement%20of%20parties%20nominated%20and%20notice%20of%20poll.pdf">http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Statement%20of%20parties%20nominated%20and%20notice%20of%20poll.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to look up your own region then theyâ€™re all listed here: <a href="http://www.europarl.org.uk/en/european_elections/candidates2014.html">The official list of candidates standing on the 2014 European Parliament elections</a> or the BBC have a version here: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27142516">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27142516</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing that stands out is how many parties are standing on an anti-European ticket. By my crude classification, 6 of the 10 parties are overtly anti-European or at least euro-sceptic, 2 are neutral and 2 are pro-European.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s a lot of anti-European sentiment. These arenâ€™t just people spouting down the pub or in the comments section of the Daily Mail, these are people whoâ€™re committed enough to get organised, fill out the requisite forms and raise the Â£5000 deposit it takes to stand for election.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s starting to feel like the last round of European elections when the BNP surprised everybody with their electoral success (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8088381.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8088381.stm</a>), which many commentators at the time put down to the lack of debate by the mainstream parties about the effect of the European Union on peopleâ€™s lives and all the related issues around immigration. This lack of debate was thought to be driving people to the BNP as the only party at the time talking about those issues, however distastefully.</p>

<p>The main parties donâ€™t seem to have learnt their lesson as they still donâ€™t seem to be interested in having that debate. For better or worse, if the mainstream parties arenâ€™t interested in talking about an issue that sections of the population care about those people will, regardless of any other idiocy in their manifesto, go and find the ones that are. Itâ€™s looking like weâ€™re seeing this happening again, this time with UKIP taking the place of the BNP.</p>

<p>###Edit 12th May</p>

<p>In my first pass, I had the Greens down as pro-European, but in digging further it turns out that while theyâ€™re pro-European as a concept, theyâ€™re pretty much against the European Union as itâ€™s constituted now. Moving them from pro to con makes that 7 out of 10 parties campaigning against the current EU.</p>
