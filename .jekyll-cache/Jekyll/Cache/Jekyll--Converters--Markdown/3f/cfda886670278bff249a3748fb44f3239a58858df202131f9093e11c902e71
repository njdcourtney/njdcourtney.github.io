I"Â<p>Apparently thereâ€™re some European elections coming up. Iâ€™ve heard the rumblings of the politicians but I wasnâ€™t really paying attention until my polling card came through the post the other day. Yes, apparently Iâ€™m part of the problemâ€¦</p>

<p>Voting is important, but itâ€™s also important to know <em>what</em> youâ€™re voting for. As the only election material Iâ€™ve seen so far in Leeds is from UKIP, several posters and a leaflet throughout the door, I thought Iâ€™d look into how easy it is to find the main partiesâ€™ election manifestos on their websites. Iâ€™m passing on the SNP as they probably arenâ€™t fielding a candidate in Leeds, but in order of their share of the vote at the last general election, hereâ€™s what I found.</p>

<p>I should note that this is just details of how easy it was to find each partyâ€™s manifesto, not a comment on the contents of that manifesto. Youâ€™ll have to read those for yourself!</p>

<p>##The Conservative Party
The Conservative website is here: <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/">http://www.conservatives.com/</a>.</p>

<p>When I was doing a first draft of this post on Sunday, I couldnâ€™t find any details of the European elections on their site, but the it seems to have been updated since then. Halfway down the page on the right hand side is a box clearly labeled â€˜EUROPEAN ELECTIONS 2014â€™. If you click on â€˜sign upâ€™ it takes you to a page where thereâ€™s a clear link to the manifesto in a number of formats.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conservatives.com/europe/~/media/Files/Downloadable%20Files/MANIFESTO%202014/Euro%20Manifesto%20English.ashx">The manifesto itself is here</a></p>

<p>Not the most obvious signposting, but the information is at least there if you go hunting for it: <strong>6/10</strong></p>

<p>##The Labour Party
The Labour party website is here: <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/home">http://www.labour.org.uk/home</a>.</p>

<p>Searching the main page for â€˜Europeâ€™ or â€˜Europeanâ€™ gives no results. You can find some hits for the word â€˜Electionâ€™ but thatâ€™s steers you to a big clock counting down to the next UK General election.</p>

<p>In the â€˜Aboutâ€™ section at the top of the page, thereâ€™s a link to â€œLabour candidates for the next electionâ€, but thatâ€™s a link to a list of candidates for the next Parliamentary elections, nothing for the European election.</p>

<p>Labour donâ€™t seem to care about the European Elections, manifesto not found: <strong>0/10</strong></p>

<p>##The Liberal Democrats
The Lib Dem website is here: <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/">http://www.libdems.org.uk/</a></p>

<p>Thereâ€™re a few references to Europe on their website, not surprising given their pro-european stance, but I couldnâ€™t find anything close to an 2014 election manifesto. Just like Labour, manifesto not found: <strong>0/10</strong></p>

<p>##UKIP</p>

<p>Ukipâ€™s website is here: <a href="http://www.ukip.org/">http://www.ukip.org/</a></p>

<p>Right at the top of the page is a dropdown menu labeled â€˜getINFORMEDâ€™ which has a link right to the manifesto, <a href="http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/themes/5308a93901925b5b09000002/attachments/original/1398167812/EuroManifestoMarch.pdf?1398167812">which is here</a></p>

<p>Manifesto found in seconds in a clear link at the top of the homepage: <strong>10/10</strong></p>

<p>##BNP</p>

<p>Sorry, not going there, not even in the name of research.</p>

<p>##The Green Party</p>

<p>The Green Party website is here: <a href="http://greenparty.org.uk/">http://greenparty.org.uk/</a></p>

<p>The Green Party donâ€™t seem to have a dedicated election manifesto, but if you click on the â€˜Electionsâ€™ link which is front-and-centre at the top of the homepage, you get directly to their list of candidates for the European elections.</p>

<p>Right next to that is â€˜Policyâ€™ link that takes you to a breakdown of the partyâ€™s policies, with links to detailed policy documents: <a href="http://greenparty.org.uk/policies.html">Green Policies</a></p>

<p>Itâ€™s not a specific election manifesto, but all the information is at least readily available: <strong>9/10</strong></p>

<p>###So what?</p>

<p>In this highly unscientific bit of poking about, it looks as though the main parties arenâ€™t all that bothered by the upcoming elections, or at least theyâ€™re not bothering much yet. The smaller parties on the other hand seem to be out of the blocks and actively campaigning.</p>

<p>When the main parties seem to be making so little effort, is it any wonder that turnouts are falling in elections? I wonder what the excuses the talking heads will come up with after the election for the turn-out and/or the swings to those parties that have actually done something to get people to vote for them?</p>
