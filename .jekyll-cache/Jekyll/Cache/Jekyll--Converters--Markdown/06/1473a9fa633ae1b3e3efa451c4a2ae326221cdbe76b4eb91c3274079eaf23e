I"÷<p>I currently use Dropbox quite a lot, itâ€™s my go-to solution for backing up photos on my phone before filing them away properly and for sharing single docs. That said, I might be reconsidering this situation soon <a href="http://www.drop-dropbox.com/">given who theyâ€™ve just appointed to their board</a>, but I digress.</p>

<p>Dropbox recently announed a new app <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/04/introducing-carousel/">Carousel</a> and I downloaded it to have a play. Itâ€™s very pretty but I couldnâ€™t see myself using it, so I pretty quickly deleted it from my phone.</p>

<p>One of the features of Dropbox that I make use of is automatic <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/289/en">camera uploads</a> but I just noticed that a couple of pictures Iâ€™d taken on my phone hadnâ€™t appeared in my Dropbox. I opened up the app, clicked the photos tab and a helpful message was at the top of the screen telling me that camera uploads were now being done by Carousel. Which Iâ€™d deletedâ€¦ Thanks dropbox, by all means move functionality to your new app but you could at least tell people!</p>

<p>A couple of clicks turned auto-uploads back on, but if you use auto uploads and have played with Carousel you might want to double-check your settings.</p>
