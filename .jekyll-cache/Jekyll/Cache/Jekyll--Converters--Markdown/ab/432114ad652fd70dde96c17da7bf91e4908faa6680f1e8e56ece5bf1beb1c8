I"×<p>You may have noticed that I havenâ€™t posted to this blog in a while, so what happened?</p>

<p><a href="/2014/10/01/done-something-stupid.html">Youâ€™ll recall from this post </a> that Iâ€™d got a place in the London Marathon. Well, it turns out that training for a marathon takes up a lot of time. A LOT of time. Runners even have a name for it, they call it paying the social debt; every minute you spend running is a minute youâ€™re not doing something else that you used to do, so some things have to give and sadly this blog was one of those things. Besides, my updates wouldâ€™ve been something along the lines of:</p>

<p>Today I went running again.<br />
I went running again today.<br />
Running again today went I.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s only a limited number of permutations of those 5 words and things wouldâ€™ve got pretty boring pretty quickly, so posting tailed off.</p>

<p>It was all going well until Christmas of last year, I was well on top of my training plan when I managed to sprain a rib by sneezing. Yes that is possible and itâ€™s one of the most painful things Iâ€™ve ever done to myself. Needless to say, this put an end to any marathon plans. Sadly it also marked the end of my mental health, I was diagnosed with depression and signed off work.</p>

<p>I might post about how Iâ€™ve managed my recovery from depression one day, but right now Iâ€™m not quite ready to put that into the public domain. suffice to say that Iâ€™ve made a number of life changes. I have a new job, Iâ€™m taking better care of myself and Iâ€™m trying to pick back up a number of projects I had on the go before I got ill, this blog being one of them.</p>

<p>So, hereâ€™s to better health, both physical and mental, and transmission resumes!</p>
