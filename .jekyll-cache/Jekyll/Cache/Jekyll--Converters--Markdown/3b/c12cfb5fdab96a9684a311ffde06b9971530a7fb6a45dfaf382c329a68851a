I"J<p>I currently use Dropbox quite a lot, it’s my go-to solution for backing up photos on my phone before filing them away properly and for sharing single docs. That said, I might be reconsidering this situation soon <a href="http://www.drop-dropbox.com/">given who they’ve just appointed to their board</a>, but I digress.</p>
