I"ª<p>I have a new favorite app - <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a></p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the problem, I find myself spending more and more time using my phone. This is great, but a lot of the time itâ€™s not the best way of absorbing information. Sometimes that article youâ€™re reading is long and you want to read it on something with a larger screen, sometimes you might stumble across something that you want to read but not right now, that article on the problems with the Greek economy sure looks interesting but itâ€™s 7:30 in the morning and Iâ€™ve not had my coffee yet.</p>

<p>Facebook and Twitter and the rest are great, but theyâ€™re very of-the-moment tools and, particularly with Twitter, if you donâ€™t open something immediately it disappears below the fold and is never seen again. This is where Pocket comes in, I can scan through all my social and news feeds on my phone and save them to read later. Itâ€™s cross platform too, so I can save things on my phone, and read them later on my tablet or laptop at my leisure.</p>

<p>I still have the problem that once Iâ€™ve read an article I canâ€™t find the original comment or tweet to reply, but one problem at a timeâ€¦</p>
