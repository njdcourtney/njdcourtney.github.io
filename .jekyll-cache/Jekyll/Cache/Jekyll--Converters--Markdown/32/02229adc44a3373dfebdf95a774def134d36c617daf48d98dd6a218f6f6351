I"y<p>I’ve not had chance to write a post for a while, things at work have been crazily busy, more about that in a future post. For now the family and I are enjoying a well-deserved holiday in the Lake District.</p>

<p>This being North-Western England, and the Lake District in particular, it’s raining so we were on the lookout for somewhere toddler friendly and indoors.</p>

<p>We settled on the “World of Peter Rabbit Attraction” in Bowness-on-Windermere: <a href="http://www.hop-skip-jump.com/">http://www.hop-skip-jump.com/</a> as somewhere toddler-friendly.</p>

<p>Being a cynical and sleep-deprived grown-up I was fearing the worst but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>The attraction is split into three parts, the first is a short film telling a bit about Beatrix Potter and the inspiration for the stories. This was well pitched with enough content to keep the adults interested but only 4 minutes or so long, so not so long that the little ones got bored.</p>

<p>The second section was a walk-through of scenes from the various stories:</p>

<p>These were really well done and, importantly, were all down at young-child height. This is something that lots of places get wrong, even those explicitly aimed at children. There’s also a lovely looking (and award-winning) garden. We gave that a miss because of the pouring rain, but the pictures looked lovely.</p>

<p>The final section is an interactive room with short films and an interactive table (think a table-sized iPad) with toddler-appropriate games and a map showing all the sites with a Beatrix Potter connection in the area, which our little one loved.</p>

<p>If you’ve got a toddler who likes the Beatrix Potter stories and you need to kill a rainy hour in the Bowness area, you can do much worse that drop in here.</p>
