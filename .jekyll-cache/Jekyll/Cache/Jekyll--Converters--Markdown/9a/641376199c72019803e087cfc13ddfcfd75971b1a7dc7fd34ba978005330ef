I"Ò<p>The next in my series of â€œapps that Iâ€™m currently lovingâ€ is <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a></p>

<p>IFTT stands for If This Then That, and the name tells you everything you need to know about what this service does. Itâ€™s an automation tool that lets you build rules for doing something.</p>

<p>The building blocks of the service are â€˜channelsâ€™ which are basically the all the services that IFTTT knows how to talk to. Each channel has a list of available triggers (the â€œIf Thisâ€ part) and a list of available actions (the â€œThen Thatâ€ part.) You use these building blocks to put together â€˜recipesâ€™ that get run automatically.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d been using IFTTT for a while to back up my Fitbit data to Google Drive, but a new channel came out two weeks ago that made me fall in love with the service all over again.</p>

<p>IFTTT launched the <a href="https://ifttt.com/wikipedia">Wikipedia Channel</a> which has a trigger for the Wikipedia Article of the Day. IFTTT also supports Pocket, so I now have a recipe that automatically pushes the article of the day into my Pocket account.</p>

<p>I get home from work, open my tablet and thereâ€™s an interesting Wikipedia article waiting for me. Neat.</p>
