I"I<p>In the world of technology, there was the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple WWDC</a> last week and <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/">E3 is just getting going</a>. (quick aside, talking of E3, my friend is live tweeting E3 over a <a href="https://twitter.com/VoosReview">@Voosreview</a>)</p>

<p>This is great, lots of cool new tech being unveiled, but it does have a darker side. All this talk of new technology means itâ€™s also tech-troll seasonâ€¦</p>

<p>We all know the sort. It doesnâ€™t matter what youâ€™ve bought or for what reason, theyâ€™ll tell you itâ€™s shit, the company youâ€™ve bought it from are evil-incarnate, youâ€™re a moron for buying it and why on Earth didnâ€™t you buy this other thing like they did all? All delivered with the sort of zealous fervour that would have a Renaissance martyr telling them to take a deep-breath and calm down.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a big believer in computers as tools, nobody cares what type of hammer you use so long as it does its job of inserted nails into wood so, in a pre-emptive strike against tech-trolls everywhere, hereâ€™s my quick guide to modern computer operating systems:</p>

<p>###Microsoft Windows
So youâ€™ve bought a new Windows computer? Great. Windows is the worldâ€™s most popular operating system (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Desktop_and_laptop_computers">Ref</a>) so youâ€™ve picked the OS with the greatest selection of software and games. Youâ€™ll be able to do everything you need, peripherals will have been tested to work with your operating system and thereâ€™s a huge wealth of support available if you hit any problems. Good job, enjoy your new computer.</p>

<p>###Apple OSX
So youâ€™ve bought a new Apple computer? Great. Apple have a well-founded reputation for building devices with a great user experience, so youâ€™ll find that most things just work without you having to fiddle with them. The tight integration between the operating system and the hardware means that youâ€™re unlikely to have any issues with the different bits of your computer not working together properly and all the applications are designed to work with each other seamlessly so you can concentrate on getting things done.  Good job, enjoy your new computer.</p>

<p>###Linux
So youâ€™ve bought a new Linux computer? Great. The open source movement is a social marvel and youâ€™re now a part of that community. Your system is open so you can see how everything works, customise it exactly how you want and if anything breaks you can get in and fix it. Thereâ€™s a huge amount of software out there available for free so youâ€™re going to be able to get everything you need without paying a penny more. Good job, enjoy your new computer.</p>

<p>###ChromeOS
So youâ€™ve bought a new Chromebook? Great. Those things are really cheap so youâ€™ve probably paid less then anybody else you know and have got something that does everything you need. Itâ€™s light, everything you do is in the cloud so you donâ€™t have to care about backups, the battery lasts for ever and the thing updates itself so you never have to worry about it. Good job, enjoy your new computer.</p>

<p>###Something obscure
So youâ€™re running something niche? Great. Youâ€™ve looked at all of the mainstream options and youâ€™ve decided to go for something else. Fantastic, you clearly know what it is youâ€™re looking for in a computer and youâ€™ve gone for something that does that. Good job, enjoy your new computer.</p>

<p>There. Now can we all just accept the people like different things, thereâ€™re pros and conns to everything and leave people in peace?</p>
