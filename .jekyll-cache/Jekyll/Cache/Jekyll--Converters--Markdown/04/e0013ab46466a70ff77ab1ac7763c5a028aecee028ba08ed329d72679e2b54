I"»<p>Thereâ€™s a HUGE bit of news today, an international team have announced that theyâ€™ve discovered gravitational waves: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35524440">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35524440</a></p>

<p>I havenâ€™t had chance to read the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102">original research paper</a> (unsurprizingly the journal website is struggling to keep up) but I fully intend to.</p>

<p>As a former astronomy, I canâ€™t express how important this is. This is massive.</p>

<p>Firstly, itâ€™s yet another confirmation that Einsteinâ€™s theory of General Relativity is correct. This might sound trivial, but the more evidence we can gather about the things we conceptually understand, the more confidence it gives us to pursue the things that we donâ€™t. Right now we donâ€™t understand what dark matter and dark energy are, but the theory thatâ€™s telling us itâ€™s out there is looking increasingly solid, so thereâ€™s clearly some interesting physics yet to be understood.</p>

<p>Secondly, this marks the beginning of a new age of astronomy. In 1610 Galileo turned his improved telescope to the heavens and discovered the moons of Jupiter. Since then weâ€™ve expanding our studies of the sky into the radio, microwave, infra-red, ulra-violet, X-ray and Gamma rays. This has lead to some remarkable discoveries, but all of these are still electromagnetic radiation, to a certain extent theyâ€™re all aspects of the same thing. Gravity waves are something different, theyâ€™re a completely different way of looking/listening (sensorary verbs start to fail when youâ€™re talking about something we can experience directly) to the Universe.</p>

<p>A new age of discovery has just begun, lets see what we can see out there.</p>
