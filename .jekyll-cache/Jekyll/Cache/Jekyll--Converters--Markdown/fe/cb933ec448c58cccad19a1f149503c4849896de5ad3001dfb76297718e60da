<p>###So what’s the problem with the Daily Mail?</p>

<p>It is my considered opinion that the Daily Mail is a horrible rag and the sooner it disappears the better, I think that’s suitably set the tone for this post. It’s not just me who holds this opinion, here’s Martin Robbins: Why The Daily Mail is Evil (some swearing if you’re at work) which makes the point much better than I ever could:</p>

<p>This is my attempt to convince people that they should stop reading the Daily Mail, or if not to stop then at the very least to realise the consequences of their actions.</p>

<p>On any typical day people have a tendency to read things that they already agree with, it’s called confirmation bias and there’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">wikipedia article on it here</a>. What this means in practice is that people have preferences for certain newspapers, blogs and websites; Guardian readers read the Guardian, Telegraph readers read the Telegraph and everybody goes about their normal lives.</p>

<p>But then, every once in a while, the Daily Mail comes along and publishes one of <em>those</em> articles, a bile filled rant about whatever subject the Daily Mail has decided to pronounce judgement on that day. What happens next is that lots of people post comments on social media about the article, it goes viral and flies around the Internet. Thousands share links to it in outrage, denouncing it and everything it stands for, spleens are vented and everybody goes to bed with the warm glow of having seen a wrong righted.</p>

<p>###But what happens next?</p>

<p>Thanks to all the people who don’t normally read the Daily Mail clicking on the shared link, the offensive article will have get a huge spike in page views, which means a huge spike in advertising revenue. When the dust has settled the business managers at the Daily Mail will review which parts of their publication have made them the most money and guess what, that offensive article has just made them a boatload of cash. The Daily Mail is a business and they’re going to keep doing the things that make them money, so whoever wrote the money-making article will most likely get a bonus and invited back to write more of the same.</p>

<p>By clicking on articles in the Daily Mail, however much you go on to denounce the contents of that article, you are directly benefiting the person who wrote it and encouraging them to write more. That’s the problem and the consequence of your action in clinking on that link.</p>

<p>Aha! I hear you cry, I use an Ad Blocker, they get no advertising revenue from me! True, but you will still be contributing to the hit counts that the Daily Mail receives and will be helping to boost their claim of being the world’s most popular newspaper website in the  world (I’m not going to link to the DM, please accept <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16746785">this page on the BBC</a> as an alternative reference) which in turn helps them to sell advertising space which then makes them money. You’re contributing less, but you’re still part of the problem.</p>

<p>###So what to do about it?</p>

<p>This is the easy bit, do nothing. Ok, its maybe not quite that easy, by doing nothing I mean proactively do nothing. If you see an article to the Daily Mail, don’t click on it and don’t share it. Ignore it. Deny them the Oxygen of publicity and the lifeblood of advertising revenue and eventually they’ll be forced to rethink their business model. They might even get back into the business of being a reasonable news outlet. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, despite the highly preachy nature of this article, I’m not going to tell anybody what they can or can’t read. If you want to read the Daily Mail then go ahead, just be aware of the consequences of your actions.</p>

<p>Rant over. I’ll leave you with this piece of comedy genius, the Daily Mail song by Dan and Dan:</p>
