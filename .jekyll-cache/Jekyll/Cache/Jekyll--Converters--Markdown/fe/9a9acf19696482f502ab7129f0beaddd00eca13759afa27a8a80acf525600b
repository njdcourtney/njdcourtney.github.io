I"‹<p>In Ruby, I often find myself writing methods that take Arrays to Emunerate over. Thereâ€™s a neat trick you can do using the Splat operator to convert a single item into an Array. This is one of those, â€œI keep losing this snippet, so Iâ€™m going to write it downâ€ posts.</p>

<pre>
# [*items] converts a single object into an array with that single object
# of converts an array back into, well, an array again
[*items].each do |item|
  # ...
end
</pre>

<p>Neat!</p>

<p>This is a very old trick that I picked up from <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/21-ruby-tricks-902.html">this post on Ruby Inside</a> back in 2008, itâ€™s number 18.</p>
