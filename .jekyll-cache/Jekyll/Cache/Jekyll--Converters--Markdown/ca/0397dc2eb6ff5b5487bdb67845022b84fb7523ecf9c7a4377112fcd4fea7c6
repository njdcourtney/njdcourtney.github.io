I"@<p>What to put as the first post?</p>

<p>Staring a blog from scratch is always a little bit intimidating.  What’s are people going to find if they scroll all the way to the end of the list of articles? Cheating horrible and completely ducking the issue, I present one of my favourite quote and an aposite one as I debug Jekyll:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.” –Brian Kernighan</p>
