I"ƒ<p>The ‚ÄúParty X should be in the TV debates‚Äù posts continue on various bits of social media and I‚Äôve written several replies like the contents of this post so I‚Äôm going to put this here so I don‚Äôt have to keep repeating myself.</p>

<p>Parliament will be dissolved on the Monday 30 March 2015 and writs issued for the General Election (<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN06574/timetable-for-the-uk-parliamentary-general-election">ref</a>) on Thursday 7 May 2015 as per The Fixed-term Parliaments Act
2011.</p>

<p>After this date, UK broadcasters are bound by the rules laid out in The Representation of the People Act 1983 (as amended) which requires that the coverage given to
each political party is in proportion to the share of the vote that party received at the preceding General Election. Not number of MPs elected, number of MEPs,
current opinion poll standing or any other measure, but share of the vote (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/">ref</a>).</p>

<p>This means that, by law, the order of precedence of parties for the next General Election is: Conservative, Labour, Lib Dem, UKIP, BNP, SNP, Green, Sinn Fein, DUP,
Plaid Cymru, etc.</p>

<p>Campaigning to expand the debates is all well and good, just be aware that the next person in line to be invited would have to be Adam Walker, currnet chair of the
British National Party.</p>

<p>Be careful what you wish for‚Ä¶</p>
