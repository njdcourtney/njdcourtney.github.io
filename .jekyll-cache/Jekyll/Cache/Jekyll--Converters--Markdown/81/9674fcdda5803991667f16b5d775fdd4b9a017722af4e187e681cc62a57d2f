I"i<p>I was ill recently. Nothing serious, just a bout of flu that knocked me off my feet for a few days. While I was in the “not well enough to go to work but not ill enough to be in bed” stages the postman delivered a load of junkmail. This set my slightly fevered brain off and I started thinking to myself “where does all that junkmail come from?”</p>
